Inputs: Primary current dipoles calculated at 15,002 points in the brian following all processing instructions in the Brainstorm tutorials (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/), with a few notable exceptions:
- Sources were mapped to the central surface instead of the pial surface to ensure localization within the grey matter for FEM analyses
- Sources were mapped using the DUNEUro FEM forward model (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Duneuro) instead of the overlapping spheres forward model
