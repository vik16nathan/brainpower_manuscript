The following scripts are used to calculate cortical thicknesses, resistances, and normalized primary current dipoles at 15,002 points in the brain.

These scripts follow all processing instructions in the Brainstorm tutorials (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/), with a few notable exceptions:
- Sources were mapped to the central surface instead of the pial surface
- Sources were mapped using the DUNEUro FEM forward model (https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Duneuro) instead of the overlapping spheres forward model
